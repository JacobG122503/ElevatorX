# ElevatorX
### Created by Jacob Garcia 

ElevatorX is a console application written in Java. It is essentially an elevator simulation. The user can pick how many floors they want their building to have. 
They can also chose how many elevators they want to have.
All of the logic will still work, no matter how many floors/elevators the user chooses.
