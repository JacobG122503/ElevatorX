# ElevatorX
### Created by Jacob Garcia 
#### 1.0.0

ElevatorX is a console application written in Java. It is essentially an elevator simulation. The user can pick how many floors they want their building to have. 
They can also chose how many elevators they want to have.
All of the logic will still work, no matter how many floors/elevators the user chooses. 

## Getting Started
When you first start the program, you are shown the three questions below. You can have as many floors/elevators you want. Depending on what you have your screen zoom set to, having 50+ might not be the best choice.
As for the last question, this is how many ticks you want to have per interval. An interval is when the simulation pauses and waits for user input to call elevators and send them where you want. If you are unsure
of what you want your number of ticks to be, I reccomend putting the ticks to equal the amount of floors you have but it's your choice.

## Intervals
Once you hit y, your building and elevators will be built. This screen is the screen you will see every time the simulation pauses at the end of an interval. At the bottom you can see it gives you some options
on what you can do. 'c' calls an elevator, 'n' unpauses the simulation and continues to the next interval. and 's' stops the program.

## Calling an elevator
When calling an elevator, you can decide what floor you want to call it to and which direction you want to send it after it arrives. After you are done creating the call, it will go back to showing your building. 
Your call has been sent, you can continue sending more calls are you can hit 'n' and continue to the next interval.
When calling an elevator, you are unable to choose which elevator. This is on purpose because you can not choose in real life.

## Arrived elevators
When an elevator arrives you can choose where to send it next, or you can simply ignore it and move on. You will be asked on each arriving elevator on where 
you would like to send it next.
